I've no father, no parent,
have no God and no homeland,
not a cradle and no shroud,
no lover, no one to hold.

For three days no food in sight,
not as much as a small bite.
My twenty years a good prize,
I sell it for a good price.

If no one puts in a bid
I'll let the devil have it.
Break in with pure heart I will,
if needed, I'll even kill.

They'll hang me when I am found
and bury in blessed ground
and deadly grass will grow out
above my beautiful heart.
